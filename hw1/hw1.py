#Exercise 1 (working with a list):
#a.	Print the first element of lst
print  lst[0]
#b.	Print the last element of otherlst
print otherlst[-1]
#c.	Print the first five elements of lst
print lst[:5]
#d.	Print the fifth element of otherlst
print otherlst[4]
#e.	Print the number of items in lst
print len(lst)
#Exercise 2 (working with a string):
#a.	Print the first four characters of s
print s[:4]
#b.	Using indexing, print the substring "test" from s
print s[10:14]
#c.	Print the contents of s starting from the 27th character (H)
print s[26:]
#d.	Print the last three characters of s
print s[len(s)-3:]
#e.	Print the number of characters in s
print len(s)
